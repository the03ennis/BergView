# Status Report: Dec. 1st

The app is coming along well! The framework for adding the widget has been completed, as has the fundamental app that displays the menu data.

The next step is actually transferring that data to the widget. At this point, I've also abandoned hope of completing an apple watch complication - I suppose they call them complications for a reason. I don't think anyone has ever moved data from a flutter app to a complication before, and unfortunately I have no intentions of being the first.

The App is not a pretty app, but maybe that can change. The Data from the API is NOT well formatted, with random code bleeds happening all over the place.

Overall, good progress is being made and I think I am on track to a functional widget soon!
